Images is named:
	"p" for pigs
	"s" for sphere
	"f" for flow
	"m" for magnitude

for all images:
	eps = 0.1

for images with 0p3:
	integration_scale = 0.3

for images with 1:
	integration_scale = 1

The gauss_conv-funciton smoothens the image with a gaussian distrobution 
where the standard deviation = integration_scale
